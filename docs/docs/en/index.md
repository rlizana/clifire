# CliFire

**Minimal CLI framework to build Python commands quickly and elegantly.**

CliFire is a lightweight library designed to simplify the creation of command line interfaces (CLI). It allows developers to define commands, options, and arguments easily, facilitating the building of complex CLI applications without the overhead of larger frameworks.

The idea behind CliFire is to enable you to create CLIs quickly and effortlessly by leveraging Python's features. Its minimalist approach and intuitive syntax make it easy to learn and use, allowing developers to focus on the logic of their applications rather than on CLI infrastructure.

Additionally, with the `fire` command, you can create dynamic commands directly from the terminal, providing an interactive and flexible experience.

## Main Features

- **Two usage styles**: decorators for a simple approach or classes for greater customization.
- **Intuitive syntax**: focused on simplicity and readability.
- **Global and per-command options**: flexible parameter configuration.
